# Print Design to CSS
A collection of Print Designs recreated in HTML & CSS/SASS using Grid, Flexbox, BEM & responsive design techniques.

Overview: I am a big admirer of magazine & print layouts; everything from the typography, style, images and the general look. I find them to be a great source of inspiration especially when I am designing for the web. Tools such as CSS Grid & Flexbox has made it easy to create such layouts. This is a side project that I enjoy doing in my spare time. I've also found this to be a good way to sharpen my CSS skillz! Here you will find a collection of layouts that I've recreated in code. Enjoy!
